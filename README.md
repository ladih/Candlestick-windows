# Trade selection using machine learning and candlestick patterns

This project explores the performance of machine learning models used for accepting or rejetcing trades, given a certain signal candle and historical candlestick data.

## Example run

Each model uses sequences of 21 one-minute candlesticks to 


predict the likelihood of 
positive returns following a “signal candle”.
