# Trade selection using machine learning and candlestick patterns

This project explores how machine learning models can identify trading opportunities 
based on historical candlestick data and signal candles.  
Models are trained and tested over defined periods, and evaluated by metrics such as 
**hit rate**, **mean return**, and **Sharpe ratio** for selected trades.
